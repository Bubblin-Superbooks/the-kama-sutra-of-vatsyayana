She speaks to him tremblingly and inarticulately. She has the fingers of her hand, and the toes of her feet moistened with perspiration, and her face blooming with delight. She occupies herself with shampooing his body and pressing his head. When shampooing him she works with one hand only, and with the other she touches and embraces parts of his body. She remains with both hands placed on his body motionless as if she had been surprised by something, or was overcome by fatigue. She sometimes bends down her face upon his thighs, and when asked to shampoo them does not manifest any unwillingness to do so. She places one of her hands quite motionless on his body, and even though the man should press it between two members of his body, she does not remove it for a long time.</p></div> </div>
