When the man, making the sound Ph&acirc;t, strikes the woman on the head, with the fingers of his hand a little contracted, it is called Prasritaka, which means striking with the fingers of the hand a little contracted. In this case the appropriate sounds are the cooing sound, the sound Ph&acirc;t, and the sound Phut in the interior of the mouth, and at the end of congress the sighing and weeping sounds. The sound Ph&acirc;t is an imitation of the sound of a bamboo being split, while the sound Phut is like the sound made by something falling into water.</p></div> </div>
