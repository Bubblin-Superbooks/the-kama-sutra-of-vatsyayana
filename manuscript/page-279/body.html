After this, when the man comes to her house the woman should give him something capable of producing curiosity, and love in his heart, such as an affectionate present, telling him that it was specially designed for his use. She should also amuse him for a long time by telling him such stories, and doing such things as he may take most delight in.

She should also sometimes go to him herself under the pretence of some business, and accompanied by the Pithamarda.</p></div> </div>
