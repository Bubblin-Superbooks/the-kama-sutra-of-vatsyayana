The Panchasakya, or the five arrows. The Smara Pradipa, or the light of love. The Ratimanjari, or the garland of love. The Rasmanjari, or the sprout of love. The Anunga Runga, or the stage of love; also called Kamaledhiplava, or a boat in the ocean of love.</p><p>The author of the 'Secrets of Love' (No. 1) was a poet named Kukkoka. He composed his work to please one Venudutta, who was perhaps a king. When writing his own name at the end of each chapter he calls himself "Siddha patiya pandita," i.e., an ingenious man among learned men. The work was translated into Hindi years ago, and in this the author's name was written as Koka.</p></div> </div>
