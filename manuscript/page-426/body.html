<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For enlarging the breasts of women. For raising and hardening pendulous breasts. For giving a fragrance to the skin. For removing the evil savour of perspiration. For anointing the body after bathing. For causing a pleasant smell to the breath. Drugs and charms for the purposes of fascinating, overcoming, and subduing either men or women. Recipes for enabling a woman to attract and preserve her husband's love. Magical collyriums for winning love and friendship. Prescriptions for reducing other persons to submission. Philter pills, and other charms. Fascinating incense, or fumigation. Magical verses which have the power of fascination.</p><p>Of the one hundred and thirty recipes given, many of them are absurd, but not more perhaps than many of the recipes and prescriptions in use in Europe not so very long ago. Love-philters, charms, and herbal remedies have been, in early days, as freely used in Europe as in Asia, and doubtless some people believe in them still in many places.</p></div> </div>
