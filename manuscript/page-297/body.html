<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Money is got out of a lover in two ways, viz.:</p><p>By natural or lawful means, and by artifices. Old authors are of opinion that when a courtesan can get as much money as she wants from her lover, she should not make use of artifice. But Vatsyayana lays down that though she may get some money from him by natural means, yet when she makes use of artifice he gives her doubly more, and therefore artifice should be resorted to for the purpose of extorting money from him at all events.</p><p>Now the artifices to be used for getting money from her lover are as follows:</p><p>1st. Taking money from him on different occasions, for the purpose of purchasing various articles, such as ornaments, food, drink, flowers, perfumes and cloths, and either not buying them, or getting from him more than their cost.</p><p>2nd. Praising his intelligence to his face.</p></div> </div>
