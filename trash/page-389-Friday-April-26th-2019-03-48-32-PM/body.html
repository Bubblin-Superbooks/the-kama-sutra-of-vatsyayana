Yes indeed, the works of men of genius do follow them, and remain as a lasting treasure. And though there may be disputes and discussions about the immortality of the body or the soul, nobody can deny the immortality of genius, which ever remains as a bright and guiding star to the struggling humanities of succeeding ages. This work, then, which has stood the test of centuries, has placed Vatsyayana among the immortals, and on This, and on Him no better elegy or eulogy can be written than the following lines:</p><p>"So long as lips shall kiss, and eyes shall see, So long lives This, and This gives life to Thee."</p><p>* * * * *</p><p class=" stretch-last-line"><em>Works issued by the Council of the</em> KAMA</p></div> </div>
