<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At festivals, singing parties and exhibitions, all the wives of the King should be treated with respect and served with drinks.</p><p>But the women of the harem should not be allowed to go out alone, neither should any women outside the harem be allowed to enter it except those whose character is well known. And lastly the work which the King's wives have to do should not be too fatiguing.</p><p>Thus ends the conduct of the King towards the women of the harem, and of their own conduct.</p><p>A man marrying many wives should act fairly towards them all. He should neither disregard nor pass over their faults, and should not reveal to one wife the love, passion, bodily blemishes, and confidential reproaches of the other. No opportunity should be given to any one of them of speaking to him about their rivals, and if one of them should begin to speak ill of another, he should chide her and tell her that she has exactly the same blemishes in her character.</p></div> </div>
