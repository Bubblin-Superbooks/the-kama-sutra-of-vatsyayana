<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> At the time when gains are sought for, if other gains come along with them, these are called attendant gains. When gain is uncertain, the doubt of its being a gain is called a simple doubt. When there is a doubt whether either of two things will happen or not, it is called a mixed doubt. If while one thing is being done two results take place, it is called a combination of two results, and if several results follow from the same action, it is called a combination of results on every side.</p><p>We shall now give examples of the above.</p><p>As already stated, gain is of three kinds, and loss, which is opposed to gain, is also of three kinds.</p></div> </div>
