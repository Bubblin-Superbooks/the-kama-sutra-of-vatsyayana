<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus end the means of attaching to herself the man desired.</p><p>There are also some verses on the subject as follows:</p><p>"When a lover comes to her abode, a courtesan should give him a mixture of betel leaves and betel nut, garlands of flowers, and perfumed ointments, and, showing her skill in arts, should entertain him with a long conversation. She should also give him some loving presents, and make an exchange of her own things with his, and at the same time should show him her skill in sexual enjoyment. When a courtesan is thus united with her lover she should always delight him by affectionate gifts, by conversation, and by the application of tender means of enjoyment."</p></div> </div>
